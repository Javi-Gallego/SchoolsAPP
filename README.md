## About the project

This platform is oriented to host different schools. Each school will have his own admin and that admin will create the "tree" of that school.

To create that "tree" the admin can create stages and add courses to these stages. Subjects can also be created and added to each course.

One of the key of the app is that users must be registered by the admin. Familys must give the data needed and the administrator will register each user. Immediately after the user is registered an email will be automatically sent by the app with the credentials. Users can be either teachers, parents, students or personal of the school.

Depending on the role of the user you can access different content.

Parents and Students can access:
- Calendar: with events as examns, works, vacations, etc. As admin or teacher you can use filters, if you are a parent or student you only can see your own events.
- Messages: a chat in which you can send and recieve messages to teachers and personal of the center.
- Nofitications: an official channel of communication of the school with students and parents.

Teachers will also have access to:
- Events: to create the events that will appear on the calendar. Fix dates to next examen or a work that has to be made.

Admin will have full access to last content and:
- Subjects: to create new subjects for the school.
- Stages: add stages that are imparted on the school (like: infantil, primaria, ESO, etc.)
- Courses: to add courses to the mentioned stages.
- Register: to create new users of the APP for the respective school.
- Users: to search for users and see their information.

***Here a sample of the frontend.

## Local installation

1. If you don't have MySQL installed on you computer, you can install Docker and execute the above command on your Powershell to create a MongoDB container
` $ docker run --name container-name -p 3310:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=1234 -d mysql `
2. Clone the repository
` $ git clone https://github.com/Javi-Gallego/SchoolsAPP.git `
3. Install dependencies
` $ npm install `
4. Run server
` $ npm run dev `
5. Run migrations on DB
` $ npm run run-migrations `
6. Mock DB with seeders
` $ npm run seeds `

## API information
<details>
<summary>Work in local</summary>
The repository has a .env_local_sample. You have to change its name to .env to work properly

In the HTTP directory there is a file named schoolapp_local.json, you can open it with 'Thunder Client' to have all the endpoints of the API. For the endpoints examples below I will use the deployed url. In the social_network_local.json you have the url with your localhost.

If you will use the API in local, you need a connection to a DB and put the credentials in the .env as needed. These credentials will be in the .env_local_sample and will work with the docker container exposed in point 1 of the local installation.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Work with deployed server</summary>
In the HTTP directory theres a file named schoolapp_deployed.json, you can open it with 'Thunder Client' to have all the endpoints of the API.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Authentication</summary>

Only registered users can access the application and only an admin can register users. Once registerd, the app will automatically send an email with the credentials to enter. So the login page is the only one you can access without credentials.
When an endpoint needs authentication you must put the token given to you when you login in the Bearer Token field in "Auth". In the login endpoint I will put the admin email and password.

 For a fast comprehension we will use icons to show what is needed to see the endpoints:
 :angel: You must be logged as admin
 :man: You must be logged as a teacher or personal
 :earth_africa: This endpoint is global and can be viewed by every user registered
